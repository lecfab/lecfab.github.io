## Overview

I am a PhD student in the computer science lab [LIP6](https://www.lip6.fr/) of Sorbonne University in Paris, under the supervision of Lionel Tabourier and Cl√©mence Magnien in the [Complex Networks](https://www.complexnetworks.fr/) team.
I'm interested in scalable graph algorithms applied on real-world datasets, with a focus on finding node orderings that improve specific algorithms in practice. I also work on citation networks and scientific trajectories as a visiting student in a [data analysis lab](https://interactiondatalab.com/). Before that, I graduated from [ENS Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/) in computer sciences and complex systems.

Feel free to contact me by email!
