## Overview

I am a PhD graduate in computer sciences, currently searching for a postdoc where to apply data analysis or algorithmic concepts to climate change research and mitigation.
I defended my thesis in the computer science lab [LIP6](https://www.lip6.fr/) of Sorbonne University in Paris, under the supervision of Lionel Tabourier and Cl√©mence Magnien in the [Complex Networks](https://www.complexnetworks.fr/) team.
It focussed on scalable graph algorithms applied on real-world datasets, specifically on finding node orderings that improve specific algorithms in practice. I also worked on citation networks and scientific trajectories as a visiting student in a [data analysis lab](https://interactiondatalab.com/). Before that, I graduated from [ENS Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/) in computer sciences and complex systems where I did research on dynamic networks.
